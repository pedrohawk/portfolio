      <p>This is one of my most recent freelance projects, focused on improving planning efficiency, time tracking, and overall business logistics through a custom ERP solution.</p>
      <p>The client needed a tailored system to meet various operational demands within the factory. The solution includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Backoffice Application:</strong> Allows managers to control and monitor all factory operations from a centralized interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Floor App:</strong> Enables operators to log real-time events related to each component they work on.</li>
        <li><strong>API & Integration Layer:</strong> Facilitates seamless communication between both applications and the database, ensuring consistent and reliable data flow across the system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Stack:</strong> .NET 8, MAUI, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server</p>

      <h2>Blackjack Wizard</h2>
      <img src="imagens/projeto2.png" alt="Imagem do Projeto 2">
      <p>This project began as a personal hobby, where I explored the fundamentals of blackjack card counting.</p>
      <p>The app is designed to help users track their blackjack sessions by recording played cards and assisting with card counting strategies in real time.</p>
      <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Java, Kotlin, Firebase</p>

    <h2>Public Transport App – Real-Time Bus Schedules and Stop Information</h2>
    <img src="imagens/projeto2.png" alt="Carris App Screenshot">
    <p>I am currently responsible for the development and maintenance of a mobile app and backend API used by several public transport operators, including Carris. The system provides real-time information about routes, lines, wait times, and nearby stops.</p>
    <p>The app was initially designed to show static data about bus lines and stops, but has evolved to include dynamic features such as live arrival estimates and vehicle tracking.</p>
    <p>The backend infrastructure synchronizes data from each transportation provider, processes it, and makes it publicly available in real time.</p>
    <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Xamarin, .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server</p>

    <h2>GTFS - General Transit Feed Specification</h2>
    <img src="imagens/projeto2.png" alt="Carris App Screenshot">
    <p>Closely related to the Public Transport App, this project involves generating GTFS feeds based on public transit data from multiple clients responsible for urban mobility.</p>
    <p>GTFS enables third-party services — such as Google — to consume standardized public transit data and provide users with information about vehicle status, trip history, and routes/bus stops data</p>
    <p>This type of project requires constant adaptation to each client’s specific context, ensuring their data is accurately transformed and mapped to the GTFS format.</p>
    <p><strong>Stack:</strong> .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server</p>

      <h2>Roulette Wizard</h2>
      <img src="imagens/projeto2.png" alt="Imagem do Projeto 2">
      <p>Inspired by the same concept as the Blackjack Wizard app, this project focuses on tracking roulette sessions in real time.</p>
      <p>It implements a strategy based on the Martingale model, offering bet suggestions for both outside and inside bets, and totally customable to adjust the risk.</p>
      <p>This was my first attempt at publishing an app on the Play Store — and the free version has already surpassed 5,000 downloads.</p>
      <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Java, Firebase</p>
